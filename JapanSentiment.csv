That is why Japan is supporting the COVAX Facility in collaborating with the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the Gavi Alliance.  COVAX Facility aims to ensure equitable distribution model supported by funds from developed countries and partners to help lower-income countries access vaccines. Since COVAX Facility's inception launch in June 2020, Japan has played a key role in this global initiative. Foreign Minister Motegi announced that Japan will contribute $200 million dollars to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment at the Fourth ACT-A Ministerial Meeting on February 9.  https://archive.ph/zednm  ",positive

While mask-wearing has become a controversial and almost political issue in some parts of the world, it is already culturally-engrained in Japan. During flu-season, but also year-round, people often wear masks to try to prevent one's own germs or sickness from spreading in public places. This is seen as particularly important in Japan's densely-populated cities. Aside from health reasons, people also regularly wear masks as a defence against dust and pollen, to cover up blemishes or the fact they are not wearing make-up, and even to make the wearer's face appear smaller! Therefore, while mask-wearing has become a hot topic in other parts of the world, they have undoubtedly become the societal norm since the spread of coronavirus, and many commentators have argued this has helped keep Japan's infection rate low. From our own observations on the ground, it seems at least 90% of people are wearing masks whenever they are outside.

With the decision to cancel the declaration in the prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka starting March 1, the focus in those areas will shift to suppressing any resurgence of the virus. Although restaurants in the affected regions will no longer be required to shorten business hours and close at 8 p.m., or shut completely, governors in those regions will likely ask them to close their doors by 9 p.m. for some time in exchange for financial compensation of up to ¥40,000 per day.

Despite the announcement we cannot find any firm dates when the policy comes in to force. Should dates become clearer at a leter date we will adjust the policy accordingly.    Kishida announced Friday that, while new cases are rising, individuals who can’t be vaccinated for health reasons and who don’t have symptoms but are concerned they have been infected can receive a PCR or antigen test before taking part in certain economic or social activities.    The plan is part of a greater effort to prepare the country for a sixth wave of the pandemic — and whatever comes afterwards — by bolstering hospitals, procuring more medical staff, expanding its vaccine campaign, administering booster shots and advancing the treatment of those with COVID-19.    “While new cases have declined substantially, it’s important to acknowledge the strong possibility that the virus will return and to prepare accordingly,” Kishida said Friday.    It’s not exactly clear who will be eligible and under what circumstances, but Kishida said Friday that the decision will be left to local governments, who have been directed to execute the plan at the latest by the end of March 2022.  https://web.archive.org/web/20211114022125/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/11/12/national/covid19-policies-free-testing/    https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050612/https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/politics/20211107-OYT1T50148/  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050745/https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/469112  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119042821/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211115/k10013349111000.html (logistics for free asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211112050813/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20211108/k10013339271000.html (considerations for asymptomatic testing)  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119050557/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000121431_00132.html  https://web.archive.org/web/20211119045214/https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/kenkou_iryou/dengue_fever_qa_00004.html",positive
